title: About
---

My name is Yinghao Wang (Michael), and I'm a Rapids SWE in Nvidia Rapids.

I contributed extensively in [cudf](https://github.com/rapidsai/cudf). My responsibilities
includes designing new features, code quality maintainance and bug fixes. I code in both
modern c++ and python.

During graduate school studies at Yale, I designed and coded a distributed raytracing
engine to render 3D graphics world. And I implemented a compiler for the Tiger language.
During undergraduate school, I implemented a rectangle segmentation algorithm to detect
photo with paper notes and extract them as single images.
I graduated from Yale University in 2020 as master of science. And graduated from
Sun Yat-Sen University as bachelor in engineering in 2018.

During my early years, I am honored to follow the award winning filmmaker, timelapse master
Thomas Lowe in production of a novel genre narrative - [AWAKEN](https://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/awaken/id1560184681).
I have assisted in image processing, editorial and data management in this evolving project. I adopted techniques such
as [neural networks](https://github.com/isVoid/DenoiseNet) to handle extreme hard case for some of the footages.

I grow to become a photography enthusiast. Throughout my trip across the globe and
meetings with artists, I developed my own perspectives in natural history and cityscape
photography. Checkout my page on photography for more.

I am fluent in Chinese and English, with intro level skill in Japanese.
